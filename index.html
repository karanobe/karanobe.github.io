<p>This site does a good job giving semantic meaning to the content by putting it
in different block-level elements. The headers follow a similar format throughout the page, and the
paragraphs are consistent as well. Also, this site does a good job linking to other pages. It is clearly 
labeled and easy to navigate through this page. I am unfamiliar with some of the html tags used in this page,
such as scrip and iframe. I believe those are CSS tags that help format and improve the aesthetics of the page.</p>
